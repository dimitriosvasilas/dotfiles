# My [.]files
My macOs development environment configuration files.  
I build my dotfiles by taking inspiration from other repositories, finding new ways to tweak my setup or organize things, and using the parts which work for me.

## Installation
```git clone https://github.com/dimitriosvasilas/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && bash bootstrap.sh ```
